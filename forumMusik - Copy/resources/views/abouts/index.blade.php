        What is it Music Listener Forum?
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        Before we discuss about what is it music listener forum, first we'll discuss about what is it forum.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        Forum are a media that people can interact each other, can give a good information each other, can do a discussion from one user to other user.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        From Indra(Inovasika,2021) Forum means a communication facility for the users. But on forum can be divided to a different channel to make the user feel ease to discuss, example like big Indonesia forum "KASKUS".
        KASKUS have alot purposes like we can search an information that we need. Forum Website has a bunch of things that
        include a data, picture, maybe animation, voice, video and all of them are connected to the network. Usually, that things were made as a hyperlink and undirectional.
        From that explanation, that's why we have an idea to make a Music Forum that an user can discuss about what is it music, or discuss about what music are they like, or what kind of music are trend right now, or what kind of music that can give a good lesson for everyday life and others.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        Features that be given on this website are :
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        1. Discuss
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        Give an option that the user can choose from the channels or we call on here is genre. Genre divided by 10 types, like : Pop, Classic, Jazz, Rock, Country, R&B, Reggae, Balada, Blues, Dangdut and Hip-hop
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        2. Playlist
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
        Show the playlist that recommended by user, that playlist also came from that famous music app we know like Spotify.
        Spotify give us a good opportunity that we can hear some musics by legal way. We can also download them but we need a VIP/Premium account first before download them, so we can have a music not from illegal way.
